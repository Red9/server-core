<!-- The Google Maps script tag should really be with the googlemaps.html
lens, but it turns out that it's subject to same origin policy. So, it's
here. 

Update: or something. I left this script in the googlemap.html file, thinking
it wouldn't do anything. Turns out, it does. It won't work with just the
script tag in googlemaps.html ("ReferenceError: google is not defined"), but
when I have both it and the script tag below I get inconsistent map loads.
Sometimes it loads, sometimes it loads a blank space. Grrr... -->

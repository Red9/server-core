### Server Core

This repository serves as the place to host all of our server side code.

If you just did a `git clone`, then be sure to run `./init.sh` to set up the
system for use. If you don't have Bash (Windows users...) you'll probably have
to run the commands manually.

Before every commit make sure to run the root `Gruntfile.js`. You can ensure
that you do this by installing a `pre-commet` hook into `.git/hooks/`. The
`./init.sh` script will do that for you, no action needed.
